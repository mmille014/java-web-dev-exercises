/*
    1. Write a static method to find the sum of all the even numbers in an ArrayList.
    Within main, create a list with at least 10 integers and call your method on the list.

    2. Write a static method to print out each word in a list that has exactly 5 letters.

    3. Modify your code to prompt the user to enter the word length for the search.

    4.BONUS: Instead of creating our own list of words, what if we want to use the string
    from the Array Practice section? Search “Java convert String to ArrayList”
    online to see how to split a string into the more flexible ArrayList collection.
